# Technical Documentation

This document provides a technical overview of the project, including details about the architecture, dependencies, and code structure.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with separation of concerns among different components. The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. The backend serves APIs consumed by the frontend and also interacts with the database.

## Dependencies

The project uses several dependencies including:
- React for the frontend
- Node.js and Express for the backend
- Jest for testing
- Babel for transpiling ES6 JavaScript code
- Webpack for bundling the frontend code

## Code Structure

The codebase is structured into separate directories for frontend and backend code. Each feature has its own directory and related files. The 'src' directory contains the source code, 'tests' directory contains the test files, and 'public' directory contains static files served by the application.

## Testing

The project uses Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, for testing. Tests can be run using the `npm test` command. The tests cover both unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for testing the interaction between different parts of the application.

## Deployment

The project can be deployed using Docker, a platform that enables applications to run in an isolated environment called a container. Instructions for deployment are provided in the 'deployment' directory.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions are documented in the 'Troubleshooting' section of the main README file. This includes issues related to setup, running the application, and running tests.
